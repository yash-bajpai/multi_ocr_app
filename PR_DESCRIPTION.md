# Multi-Engine OCR App - Major Update

## 🚀 Summary
This PR overhauls the application to be **100% local, fully portable, and automated**. It removes dependencies on cloud services (Google Cloud Vision, AWS Textract) and ensures that all OCR engines (Tesseract, PaddleOCR, EasyOCR) work out-of-the-box on any Windows machine without manual installation.

It also introduces a modern, responsive UI ("Neural Workbench").

## 🛠Key Changes

### 1. Automation & Portability
*   **New `setup_and_run.ps1` Script:** A single-click setup script that:
    *   Creates a Python 3.10 virtual environment.
    *   **Auto-installs Tesseract:** Checks for Tesseract; if missing, downloads and installs it locally (`Portable Mode`).
    *   **Auto-installs Poppler:** Downloads and configures Poppler for PDF support.
    *   **Auto-downloads Models:** Pre-fetches PaddleOCR and EasyOCR models.
*   **Dependency Management:** Cleaned `requirements.txt` (removed `boto3`, `google-cloud-vision`) and pinned versions for stability.

### 2. Backend Refactoring
*   **Local-First:** Removed all cloud OCR integration code.
*   **Engine Improvements:**
    *   **PaddleOCR:** Fixed compatibility issues, silenced debug logs, and optimized initialization.
    *   **Tesseract:** Updated to check for a local portable installation before falling back to system paths.
*   **Persistence:** The app now remembers your selected OCR model between requests.

### 3. Frontend Overhaul
*   **New UI (`app.html`):** Replaced the basic `index.html` with a modern, "Neural Workbench" interface using Tailwind CSS.
*   **MathJax Support:** Added MathJax to properly render mathematical formulas in the "Theory" section.

### 4. Project Structure
*   **Clean Git:** Updated `.gitignore` to specifically exclude the autogenerated local binaries (`tesseract-ocr/`, `poppler_lib/`) and virtual environments.

## ✅ Verification
This setup has been verified to be fully reproducible on fresh Windows environments.

**How to test:**
1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Run `.\setup_and_run.ps1`.
3.  The app will launch automatically.
